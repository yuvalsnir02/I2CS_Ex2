 * This interface represents a 2D map as a raster matrix, image or maze.
 * Ex2: Intro2CS - do NOT change this interface!
 * The data is assumed to be a rectangular 2D matrix (not a ragged array).
 * This interface includes the following functionalities:
 * 1. basic: init, copy, get dimensions.
 * 2. draw: rectangle, line, circle.
 * 3. set: rescale, add (another map), mul (by scalar), crop.
 * 4. shortest path (obstacle avoiding).
 * 5. shortest distances from a source coordinate to each entry in this map (obstacle avoiding).
 * 6. fill a connected component with a new color.
